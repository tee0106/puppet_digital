<!--

The purpose of this file is to demonstrate how to configure a locally installed Microsoft Speech Recognizer
for use with relevant tools included in the Microsoft Speech Platform SDK.

In this example, the Properties element below shows how to configure the engine with additional engine properties.

As an important reminder, in order to configure a local engine, you must have installed both the
Speech Platform Runtime in addition to a runtime language (i.e., language pack or specific language engine).

-->


<Configuration>

   <!-- Indicates that the recognizer is installed locally -->
   <Provider type="local"/>  

   
	<!--Only the 'enginerequiredattributes' values are required for the local 
		MS Speech Server engine Provider; all others properties are optional:  --> 
	
	<Properties
		enginerequiredattributes="Language=409;Vendor=Microsoft">
	</Properties>
   
	<!--Here's an example when using the Properties element to specify additional properties:
   
	<Properties
		completetimeout="0.25s" incompletetimeout="3s"
		maxnbest="4" requesttimeout="15s" enginerequiredattributes="Language=409;Vendor=Microsoft"
		engineoptionalattributes="CommandAndControl">
	</Properties>
   
	-->

	<!--If you want to pass in one or more cookies with each utterance request,
		you would do so as follows: 
	
	<CookieJar>
		<cookie name="cookie_number_1" value="some_value" domain=".foo.com" path="/bar" secure="true"/>
		<cookie name="cookie_number_2" value="some_value" domain=".foo.com" path="/bar" secure="true"/>
	</CookieJar>

	-->

	
</Configuration>
